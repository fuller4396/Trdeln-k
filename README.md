# Trdeln-k
The Trdelník Calculator is a fun JavaScript script that estimates how many trdelníks (delicious Czech pastries sold all over Prague) you’d eat based on your time in the city and your love for sweets. With a dash of humor, it calculates your "trdelník consumption" and delivers quirky messages about your Prague experience.
